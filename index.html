        <p>My name is Max Romano. I am a third semester RVCC student majoring 
        in Math, Computer Science, and IT. I also work at the Help Desk on 
        campus. I have a sister named Shayna and a pet dog named Cooper.
        Shayna is 17 years old and is a senior in high school. Cooper is a 5
        year old Britney Spaniel.</p>

        <p>Professor, if you are actually reading this, I have a friend who
        is very into linguistics and language in general. I know nothing about
        it, but he found your blog online and saw that you work at RVCC. I
        told him that you are my professor, and he wanted me to ask you why
        you stopped uploading lessons about Galilean, whatever that is.</p>
