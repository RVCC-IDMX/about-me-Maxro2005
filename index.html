                <p>Hello there! My name is Max, and I am currently a student at Raritan Valley Community College. I am a third semester student and, as I am writing this, in my last week of classes for the semester. By the time I graduate next spring, I will have three associates degrees in math, computer science, and IT. I completed my computer science curriculum last semester, am completing my math curriculum this semester, and will be completing my IT degree over the spring. I also work part time at the Help Desk on campus. Besides that, I have a mom, dad, sister, and dog. In my free time, I typically play video games (mainly League of Legends) or watch YouTube/Twitch.</p>

                <p>I cannot believe how much I have learned from this course (Web Development I). I went from knowing next to nothing about web development, HTML, and CSS, to being able to not only code a fleshed-out website AND make it look decent, but also knowing a lot more about best practices for websites. One crucial takeaway from this course was the importance of responsive design. I always subconsciously knew that it was in important but never really thought about the fact that the majority of visitors will be using phones. On the whole, I am very glad I took this course and believe what I learned will come to great use throughout my college and work life. Even if I do not go into web development, having a fundamental understanding of how websites work will be beneficial.</p>

            <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes</h2>

            <div>

                <p>It is simple enough to create a visually appealing website. With a basic understanding of CSS as well as flexbox and grid, you can style your webpage to look almost however you would like it to. However, it is not enough for a website to just look good. Most websites are meant to be interacted with. The most common example of this are hyperlinks, where you click on a word or set of words that are usually a different color or underlined and are brought to a different part of the website or a different website altogether.</p>

                <p>However, there is another type of website interaction known as hover effects. A hover effect occurs when the user hovers their cursor over the element. A common example of this is a hover effect for a link. Have you ever noticed that oftentimes, when you hover over a link, it changes color? That is a hover effect. Hover effects are simple enough to code in CSS. All you need to do is add :hover to the element you want to create the hover effect for in your stylesheet and then write the CSS declarations that you want. For instance, if I wanted to make my a tags turn red when I hover over them, I would write: a:hover { color: red; }.</p>
                
                <p>This is all cool stuff, but what I really want to talk about in this blog article is image hover effects. Simply put, these are effects that trigger when the user hovers over an image. To get a sense of what kinds of effects you can have, check out this <a href="https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ">CodePen</a>. My personal favorites are circle and blur.</p>

                <p>Adding hover effects to your webpage makes it more interesting and interactive. They make images look better when they are focused on, and, quite honestly, they are simply fun to use. The feeling of an image doing a little transition when you hover over it is very satisfying, and you know the web developer put in great effort to make this page. Except that they didn't, because as I discussed earlier in this article, hover effects are very easy to code. In fact, they are so easy to code that I, a Web Development I student, have created my own image with a hover effect at the end of this article (please try it for yourself).</p>

                <p>Now, there are other options for image animations, but they are not preferred in most cases. This is for two main reasons. First, other animation solutions are typically much harder to implement than CSS hover effects. Second, hover effects load quickly and add minimal overhead to the webpage. The only thing more important than how a website looks is how it functions, so the last thing you want is for your website to load and respond slowly because you have a complex animation constantly running. The last aspect of image hover effects that makes them so useful is that no matter how many you add to your page, it will still not slow the page down. On the whole, image hover effects are incredibly useful and significantly improve a webpage. Everyone should consider using them in their next website.</p>
